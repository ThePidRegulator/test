%What is Main going to contain
%Description of what main dose 
%Main will be where different orbit cenarios will can be defined
%Once a orbit scenario is simulated it will be stored in a format that allows for
%faster SatASDC simulation
%This should be capable of simulating:
%Specific orbit
%Sun Sat iraidiance
%Earth Sat iradiance
%Magnetic field Vector
%Gravity Vector
%Other environmental torquers on Orientation
